# Microsoft is proving again that it doesn't deserve Minecraft.

Mojang has announced the details for the new Minecraft release - 1.19, and spoiler alert: *I absolutely hate this.*

---

Now. Keep these in mind:

- Minecraft is marketed as a sandbox game.

- Mojang develops Minecraft and it was bought by Microsoft in 2017.

- The Java edition of the game has mostly remained uninfluenced by Microsoft, meanwhile Microsoft tried to promote its edition of Minecraft, called Minecraft Bedrock, and that was far from what Minecraft originally was.

On October 21st, 2020, Minecraft's official YouTube channel posted this video: [Java Account Migration: A Fun Announcement by Dinnerbone ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9cqIwrgz7w). Here, they announced that Minecraft Java edition players will have to migrate their accounts to a Microsoft account. And by the time of writing this blog post, the migration process is mostly done.

This might sound harmless but what this means is that Minecraft Java edition players have to now abide by Microsoft's terms, agreements, policies, blah blah blah. This is not a new thing for Minecraft Bedrock Edition players, and that's why there was quite some skeptisism on the internet about this move.

## The Issue

So here we are, it's the last week of June, 2022, Mojang has now announced the details for Minecraft 1.19. And here's what they've introduced: [Player Chat Reporting in Minecraft: Java Edition](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/7149823936781-Player-Chat-Reporting-in-Minecraft-Java-Edition#:~:text=Reporting%20can%20be%20accessed%20via,be%20included%20in%20the%20report.).

And here's where the Microsoft account comes in.

> As a part of that work, Mojang Studios moderates harmful content and behaviors that don’t follow the [Microsoft Services Agreement](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/servicesagreement/) as explained in the Community Standards for [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/community-standards) and [Xbox](https://www.xbox.com/en-CA/legal/community-standards), but we can’t be everywhere at once. That’s where you, our players, come in. You are our community, and you help us keep Minecraft fun and safe.

Now you might start to see how this unfolds. Bedrock edition has chat (signs and books too) filter, even on singleplayer mode.

You thought that sucks? It gets worse.

On Minecraft Bedrock edition, players can get banned from the entire game from these chat reports. This is NOT what I call a sandbox game. Like- why ban someone from even accessing their single player worlds for breaking the rules in some multiplayer server?

Oh and the players have to manually cancel their realms subscription after they get banned, till that, they'll basically be donating to Microsoft for literally nothing.

#### Okay, these are on Bedrock edition, Java is still fine right? i.e they literally said they won't affect the default Java gameplay.

So far, Mojang has introduced chat reporting  that can get you banned from playing in  any multiplayer server. Oh and by the way, if you're wondering, players tried doing universal bans back in the good old days and it had proven that it's a bad system for a sandbox game.

Another thing about chat reporting is that, it's in a fucking game that involves violence (though fantasy). What if I say "I'm def gonna kill you" in a pvp match, win, and the opponent gets salty and reports that line? And poof, 26 USD wasted because of some stupid corporation.

Yea that's all I've got to say for now. Might quit Minecraft if this is getting worse. Cya later, have a good day.
